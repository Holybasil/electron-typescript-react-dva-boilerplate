* React + Dva = Enhanced "React + Redux + React Router"
* HMR supported
* Electron extensions installed: react developer tools, redux dev tools




## 1 Step to Get Started
Copy all following codes, paste them on your terminal, press enter, and press enter again after installation to launch the project.
```base
git clone https://github.com/ts-boilerplate/electron-typescript-react-dva-boilderplate.git
cd electron-typescript-react-dva-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
> Note: `package.json` only consists of 2 basic properties: `devDependencies` and `scripts`, other remaining properties like `name`, `description` can be added freely.  
Current `package.json`:
>```js
>{
>  "scripts": {...},
>  "devDependencies": {...}
>}
>```

Then you would enjoy an awesome coding experience with typescript, react, dva, and hmr.
