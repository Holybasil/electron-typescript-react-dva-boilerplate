## Features
![Example gif](https://ts-boilerplate.github.io/CDN/electron-typescript-react-dva-boilderplate/example.gif)

* All scripts(server, main, renderer) are written in typescript
* React + Dva = Enhanced "React + Redux + React Router"
* HMR supported
* Electron extensions installed: react developer tools, redux dev tools




## 1 Step to Get Started
Copy all following codes, paste them on your terminal, **press enter** even though terminal has started cloning.
```base
git clone https://github.com/ts-boilerplate/electron-typescript-react-dva-boilderplate.git
cd electron-typescript-react-dva-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
> Note: `package.json` only consists of 2 basic properties: `devDependencies` and `scripts`, other remaining properties like `name`, `description` can be added freely.  
Current `package.json`:
>```js
>{
>  "scripts": {...},
>  "devDependencies": {...}
>}
>```

After a while, an electron window would launch, and then you would enjoy an awesome coding experience with typescript, react, dva, and hmr.
