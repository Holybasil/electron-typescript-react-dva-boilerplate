## 2 Steps to Get Started
1. Clone this repository to local
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ts-boilerplate/electron-typescript-react-dva-boilderplate.git
```
2. Install dependencies and start
```base
npm install
npm start
```
> Note: `package.json` only consists of 2 basic properties: `devDependencies` and `scripts`, other remaining properties like `name`, `description` can be added freely.  
Current `package.json`:
>```js
>{
>  "scripts": {...},
>  "devDependencies": {...}
>}

Then an electron window would lauch, and you would enjoy an awesome coding experience with typescript, react, dva, and hmr.
